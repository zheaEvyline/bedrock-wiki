## Introduction

[Sourced By Bedrock Commands Community Discord](https://discord.gg/SYstTYx5G5)

This system allows you to track how many players/entities are there on your world and run your desired commands based on the values obtained.

> Note: you cannot track entities in unloaded chunks though players can still be tracked regardless.

## Setup

*To be typed in Chat:*

`/scoreboard objectives add total dummy`

If you prefer to have the objective added automatically on world initialisation, follow the process outlined in [On First World Load.](/docs/commands/on-first-world-load)

## System

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/entity_counter.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```yaml
scoreboard players set onlinePlayers total 0
execute as @e [type=player] run scoreboard players add onlinePlayers total 1

#Your Commands Here (examples)
execute if score onlinePlayers total matches 4.. run title @a actionbar Enough players to start game.
execute if score onlinePlayers total matches ..3 run title @a actionbar Not enough players.
```

Here we have used a FakePlayer name `onlinePlayers` and targeting `@e [type=player]` to track how many players are currently on the world. However you may use any FakePlayer name and target any entity you might need. Such as `@e [type=creeper]`

Similarly we're running a `/title` command as an example;
- a) when there are 4 or more players `4..`
- b) when there are 3 players or less `..3`

You can edit this as well to suit your need.

## Explanation

- The first two commands in the system sets the FakePlayer name's score to 0 (here `onlinePlayers`) and from each loaded entity we want to track (here `type=player`) it will add a score to the specified FakePlayer name (here `onlinePlayers`)

Now based on the values obtained we can use the `/execute if score` command to run our desired commands when certain values are met.
- **` n `** any number n
- **` n.. `** any number n and above
- **` ..n `** any number n and below
- **` n1..n2 `** any number n1 to any number n2.

## Tick Json
To get this funtion to run in a loop contuously it must be added to tick.json or a command block. Multiple files can  added to the tick.json by placing a ccommon after each string. See [Functions](/commands/mcfunctions#tick-json) for more details.

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/tick.json</CodeHeader>
```json
{
  "values": [
    "entity_counter"
  ]
}
```

## notes on Compatibbility
The Scoreboard names (onlinePlayers in this case) may end up being used by other people. appending and _ and a set of randomly generated characters after onlinePlayers would be a choice that reduces the probability of colisions. Similar techniques can be employed for the filenames in the .mcfunction files.
